[200~Said she tired of lil' money, need a big boy
Pull up twenty inch blades like I'm Lil' Troy
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy
Shawty mixin' up the vodka with the LaCroix, yeah
G-Wagon, G-Wagon, G-Wagon, G-Wagon
All the housewives pullin' up (up, up, up)
I got a lot of toys
720S bumpin' Fall Out Boy
You was talkin' shit in the beginning (mmh-mmh)
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin' (more forgivin')
I know it piss you off to see me winnin' (see me winnin')
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin' (I be grinnin'), yeah
Hundred bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hundred deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely.
